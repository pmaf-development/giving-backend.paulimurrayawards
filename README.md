# Pauli Murray Awards Foundation - Server API

Backend code for the Pauli Murray Awards Foundation.

## Getting started
1) `npm install` to install all project dependencies
2) Run server with `npm start` or `node app.js`

## Deployments
Code is served from [], and pushed directly from the `main` branch.
**Note** Please test all changes before pushing directly. There currently are no tests, so there's the potential of breaking the client application. 

A great third-party resource to test API changes is [Postman](https://postmain.com):
